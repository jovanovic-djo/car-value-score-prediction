## Data Science / Machine Learning AVNET Internship Project
###### Project structure understanding guide is below milestone approach explanation
### Car Value Score Prediction Project Documentation
###### Through the following points, we will discuss and explain logic, thoughts and results of this project. <br /> As agreed with the mentor, the project structure follows a logical organization of directories rather than milestone-based segmentation, reflecting best practices in real-world data science projects.
#### Structure of the project (minor files excluded):

#### Problem Understanding and Exploratory Data Analysis
In this milestone exploratory data analysis is done using several Python libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and pandas.
Data had no missing values nor inconsistencies.
Several visualizations are created using uppermetntioned libraries for values distribution insights.
#### Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
Ordinal encoding is applied to dataset with additional renaming of the columns.
No additional features are added.
Data is splited into test and train set which are additionally scaled using StandardScaler().
#### Model Development and Evaluation
Six classification models are trained and saved in 2 types of format for reusability.
Four metrics are used for model evaluation.
Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are implemented
#### Visualization and Presentation
